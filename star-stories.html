      <h2>🧩 Complexity</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>📝 Situation</h3>
          <p>During a semester-long analytics project, my team was tasked with analyzing two large datasets (FCC
            Complaints and Baza Telecom) that contained inconsistent formats, missing values, multiple time fields, and
            over a dozen variables that required transformation before analysis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🎯 Task</h3>
          <p>My responsibility was to simplify the data pipelines, reduce confusion among team members, and create a
            clear processing flow that would allow us to run descriptive and predictive models without major delays.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🚀 Action</h3>
          <p>I reorganized the datasets in Tableau Prep, created data-type validation rules, grouped related variables,
            and documented each transformation step in a shared workflow diagram. I also developed a standardized naming
            convention so all team members could follow the same logic. To handle complexity, I broke the work into
            clear phases—ingestion, cleaning, validation, and modeling—so everyone knew where their part fit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🏆 Result</h3>
          <p>We reduced prep time by 40%, eliminated repeated errors, and produced a dataset clean enough for regression
            modeling and visual dashboards. The professor highlighted our pipeline clarity as one of the strongest parts
            of the project..</p>
        </div>

    <section id="leadership">
      <h2>👥 Leadership</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>📝 Situation</h3>
          <p>In a project management course, my team struggled with unclear direction and inconsistent participation on
            a milestone that required heavy coordination: status reporting, risk updates, and a data-driven deliverable.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🎯 Task</h3>
          <p>I stepped into an informal leadership role to help the group regain structure, clarify responsibilities,
            and ensure the milestone was completed on time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🚀 Action</h3>
          <p>I facilitated a short virtual meeting, created a mini-WBS showing each member’s task, and implemented
            check-ins on Teams. I uploaded my own progress early to set the tone and personally supported teammates who
            were stuck by pairing with them to solve technical issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🏆 Result</h3>
          <p>Our team delivered the milestone two days early and received positive feedback for organization. Team
            communication improved significantly, and several members said the clarity helped them perform better in the
            next milestone.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="value">
      <h2>💡 Value</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>📝 Situation</h3>
          <p>At my previous job, I noticed our customer support team was constantly overwhelmed. Agents were staying
            late, customers were frustrated with long wait times, and morale was dropping. I wasn’t asked to step in—but
            I felt the issue was hurting both the team and the company.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🎯 Task</h3>
          <p>I wanted to understand what was really driving the spike and see if there was a way to add value without
            simply throwing more people at the problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🚀 Action</h3>
          <p>I spent a few lunches sitting with the support team, listening to the types of calls they handled. I
            realized many agents were answering the exact same questions—things customers could easily resolve if they
            had clearer self-service options.
            So, on my own initiative, I pulled three months of support data, grouped issue types, and calculated the
            impact of repetitive calls. I then proposed a simple but targeted solution: improve the FAQ and automate the
            top five repetitive requests.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🏆 Result</h3>
          <p>After the changes rolled out, repetitive calls dropped significantly, and average wait times improved. The
            team felt relief almost immediately.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="risk">
      <h2>⚠️ Risk</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>📝 Situation</h3>
          <p>When I worked in customer service, our team was preparing to switch to a new ticketing system. During early
            training sessions, I noticed that some features didn’t load properly on the older computers still used at
            the front desk. Most people didn’t notice because they were testing on newer equipment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🎯 Task</h3>
          <p>Although it wasn’t my job to evaluate software, I felt responsible to bring up the issue because slow
            ticket handling would directly impact customers and increase wait times.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🚀 Action</h3>
          <p>I tested the system across different stations and documented which areas lagged or froze. I then shared the
            findings with my supervisor and suggested delaying full implementation until IT could optimize the setup or
            upgrade the front-desk computers. I also proposed a temporary workaround: routing more complex tickets to
            the back office where machines ran faster.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🏆 Result</h3>
          <p>IT confirmed the issue and released a patch before launch. The system ran smoothly for everyone on day one,
            and our customer queue times stayed normal during the transition. My supervisor appreciated that I paid
            attention and spoke up before the problem reached customers.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="tailoring">
      <h2>🎯 Tailoring</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>📝 Situation</h3>
          <p>In a previous job, I was responsible for onboarding new team members. We had a standard training process,
            but one new hire struggled because English wasn’t their first language, and the training documents were
            dense and full of technical terms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🎯 Task</h3>
          <p>I wanted to make sure they felt supported and confident in their new role, so I decided to adjust the
            training approach while still covering all the required steps.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🚀 Action</h3>
          <p>I broke the training into smaller sessions, walked through procedures hands-on instead of relying on long
            manuals, and created simplified step-by-step guides with screenshots. I also paired with them for the first
            few customer interactions to make sure they felt comfortable asking questions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>🏆 Result</h3>
          <p>The new hire became fully trained faster than expected and later became one of the most reliable members on
            the team. My manager appreciated the initiative and told me to use the tailored format for future new hires
            because it made the onboarding process smoother for everyone.</p>
